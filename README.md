# A Better Music Blog
A project with the intention of designing a "better" template for music blogs/blogging 

## Goal

After co-running [Cereal + Sounds](www.cerealandsounds.com) for two years and being exposed to more music blogs than I've ever been (though I read a lot in high school), I've come to the realization that music blogs require a certain design to house audio, text and images. It might sound simple but there needs to be a special design evoked to balance these three elements, neither one over powering the other.

This repo might be a the eventual redesign of [Cereal + Sounds](www.cerealandsounds.com) or a template for someone else's music blog, but this will be an on going project to make the best music blog.
